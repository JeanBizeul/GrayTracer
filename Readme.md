## What is it ?
The Raytracer project is, well... A raytracer !

It aims to be as modular as possible to allow easy addition / upgrade of different features that composes it.

You can take a look at the newcomers documentation we wrote which explains why we took certain decisions and how to add your own models, lights, materials, ...

The raytracer also features a fully scipted scene manager using libconfig++ file format and C++ library.

**You can find the documentation under the [doc folder](<doc/How to read.md>) located at the root of the repository.**
